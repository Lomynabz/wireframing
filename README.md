# wireframing
## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website, application, or software interface. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality without getting into design details like colors or graphics.

## Importance in the Design Process
- **Clarifies Layout and Structure:** Helps stakeholders and designers understand the placement of elements and navigation flow.  
- **Reduces Miscommunication:** Provides a visual reference to align expectations between developers, designers, and clients.  
- **Saves Time and Cost:** Identifies potential usability and functionality issues early, reducing the need for costly changes later.  
- **Guides Development:** Serves as a blueprint for UI designers and developers, ensuring consistency in design and implementation.  
- **Facilitates Feedback:** Stakeholders can provide feedback on functionality and user experience before detailed design or coding begins.
